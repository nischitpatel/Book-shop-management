# Book-shop-management

- This project is created in C++ language
- In this project I have applied the concept of file handling techniques like read, write, append.
- It performs various operations like add new book, update book records, search specific book, delete book.

Add new book:
  - It will asks user to enter new book name, book id, author name, total quantity of books available
  
Update book:
  - It will asks user to enter book id
  - Then it will check if book with entered id  is present or not
  - If it is present then it will ask user to update book name, author name and total quantity
  
Delete book:
  - It will asks user to enter book id
  - Then it will check if book with entered id  is present or not
  - If it is present then it will delete that book from records
  
Display books:
  - This function will display all books details that are present in record
  
Search book:
  - It wil asks user to enter book id
  - Then it will check if book with entered id  is present or not
  - If it is present then it will display "book found" and also display all the details related to that book
